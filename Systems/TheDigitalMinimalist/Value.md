Core personal values include **felicity** and **benignity**/**benevolence**, as well as **creativity**, **authenticity** and **autonomy**.

From a group-level perspective, the following are vital:

- **Meritocracy** (as in, merit-based[^merit]), in regards to opportunities[^fair] 
- **Equity and parity** (not to be confused with equality), in regards to interactions[^exp]

[^fair]: In America (amidst its [culture war](https://themotte.zettel.page/cw)), [FAIR](https://www.fairforall.org/) as a group seeks to uphold such values.
[^merit]: Where 'merit' is a clearly-defined word referring, here, to *"talent, effort, and achievement, rather than wealth or social class"*.
[^exp]: 
    > R: So as to explicate why equity and parity is the sensible approach, perhaps you may be inclined to consider two very common platitudes ... but juxtaposed for clarity. Vis.: ‘we are all unique’/‘we are all equal’
