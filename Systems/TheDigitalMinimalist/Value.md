Core personal values include **felicity** and **benignity**/**benevolence**, as well as **creativity**, **authenticity** and **autonomy**.

From a group-level perspective, the following are vital:

- **Meritocracy** (as in, merit-based[^merit])
- **Equity and parity** (not to be confused with equality)[^fair]

[^fair]: In the context of [Identity Politics](https://themotte.zettel.page/cw), [FAIR](https://www.fairforall.org/) as a group seeks to uphold these values.
[^merit]: Where 'merit' is a clearly-defined word referring, here, to *"talent, effort, and achievement, rather than wealth or social class"*.
