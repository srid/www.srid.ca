    Why not popular social media platforms like Twitter? First, it is [not "social"](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/njxq6h/status_anxiety_as_a_service/gzavjca/?context=3) in the felicitous sense of the word; second, to steer clear of the [hivemind contagion](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788) of their ill-humored ambiance, best expressed in:
    > *Twitter's conversational landscape is like the Everglades; it's a big nasty swamp, stinking pools everywhere and lots of alligators and snakes.*

In regards to reddit, while most of its communities suffer from similar dynamics, some niche subreddits (eg: r/TheMotte) still uphold sensibility with little group-think.
