[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an advanced, purely functional programming language. I use Haskell because of its correctness guarantees that are difficult or impossible to achieve with mainstream programming languages[^gotcha].

[^gotcha]: Do be wary of [[Haskell Gotchas]].

My first foray into Haskell was to write fullstack web applications using [[Reflex-FRP]], after having used Elm prior to that. Nowadays I consider it my go-to language for general application development.

[On GitHub](https://github.com/srid) you can find a list of Haskell projects I work on, the notable of which is [[Neuron]] and now [[Emanote]].

## Learning Haskell

* **Books**: Some prefer *concise* learning materials; if this is you, check out the two books by Graham Hutton and Richard Bird. For a thorough and practical book, Vitaly Bragilevsky's Haskell in Depth or Will Kurt's Get Programming with Haskell might be interesting.
* **Self-learning courses**: [fp-course](https://github.com/system-f/fp-course) and [applied-fp-course](https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course)
* **Practice**: Learning anything takes practice, and this is particularly critical for Haskell. See [Haskell Mentors List](https://willbasky.github.io/Awesome-list-of-Haskell-mentors/) for progressing in learning Haskell by way of contributing to open source projects.
