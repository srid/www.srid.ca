[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an advanced, purely functional programming language. I use Haskell because of its correctness guarantees that are difficult or impossible to achieve with mainstream programming languages[^gotcha].

[^gotcha]: Do be wary of [[Haskell Gotchas]].

I began using Haskell in order to write fullstack web applications using [[Reflex-FRP]], after coming from Elm background. Nowadays I consider it my go-to language for general application development.

[On GitHub](https://github.com/srid) you can find a list of Haskell projects I work on, the notable of which is [[Neuron]].
