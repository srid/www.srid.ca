A couple of useful heuristics in regards to the feeling of "*trust*"[^def]:

[^def]: > Trust is the ‘faith or conviction in the loyalty, strength, veracity, etc., of a person or thing; reliance on the truth of a statement etc., without examination’ ... and faith is ‘belief, especially without evidence or proof’ ---[On Faith and Trust](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-faithtrust.htm)

First, from Scott Adam's *Loserthink*[^rev]

[^rev]: Reviewed [here](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/08/book-review-loserthink/)

> it is a bad idea to trust the majority of experts in any domain in which both complexity and large amounts of money are involved.

Second, my own ([example](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/n6b9bg/how_should_we_think_about_guidelines_for/gx6k9bw/?context=3)),

> if something is controversial, with its [heterodox](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heterodox) views being [censored](https://reclaimthenet.org/), there is a good chance of it being less than true.
